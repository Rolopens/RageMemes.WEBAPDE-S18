Mike Schiller of ''[[PopMatters]]'' found that many of the mid-tempo songs could "slowly turn from a warm blanket into a test of endurance" with their "hazy and gauzy" production, but was nonetheless impressed by Moby's success in "turning despair and hopelessness into something engaging" for the record.<ref name="popmatters" /> In a mixed review, ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s Sasha Geffen felt that Moby's vocals sound "anaemic" throughout the record due to the "circuitousness of his lyrics" and found the album minor compared to Moby's earlier works despite its strengths.<ref name="pitchfork" /> ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin's]]'' Annie Zaleski deemed the record to be a "let down—the equivalent of a sad, deflated Mylar balloon" compared to Moby's previous "buoyant" albums, with the "sturdy hooks" and "promises of haunting emotional vistas" not being fully embraced.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.spin.com/2018/03/review-moby-everything-was-beautiful-nothing-hurt/ |title=Review: Moby’s Everything Was Beautiful, and Nothing Hurt Is an Uninspired Take on Trip-Hop |last=Zaleski |first=Annie |date=March 6, 2018 |website=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180609143005/https://www.spin.com/2018/03/review-moby-everything-was-beautiful-nothing-hurt/ |archive-date=June 9, 2018 |accessdate=June 13, 2018}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Times]]'', [[Will Hodgkinson]] wrote that "those mourning the loss of 1990s trip-hop will have their prayers answered", but felt that the record is "rather portentous and, frankly, a bit boring".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/pop-review-moby-everything-was-beautiful-and-nothing-hurt-j8qxcjpkk |title=Pop review: Moby: Everything Was Beautiful, And Nothing Hurt |last=Hodgkinson |first=Will |authorlink=Will Hodgkinson |date=March 2, 2018 |work=[[The Times]] |accessdate=June 14, 2018 |subscription=yes}}</ref>
